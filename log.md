# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Tempalate (Copy me and remove text, shows example)
### Day 0: Date

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Doing a review on FCC site. Starting at the beginning because I haven't looked at HTML or CSS in a long time and want to get better at front end. Remember as styles go down they override those above. inline trumps this. Id's trump classes, and `!important` trumps all. *Update*: Spent 10 extra minutes to just finish the whole HTML5 and CSS section. Onward to responsive design and bootstrap!

**Thoughts:** Its sorta like riding a bike but the CSS review is immensely helpful and how overriding works! Looking forward to using this on an actual project. I really would like to finish the certifications and do something with them! The program looks nice and I burned through a lot in an hour (per update above, this should take 5 hours)

### Day 2: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on two kata's on Code Wars website. First of which was counting vowels. I completed this in both java and python. The second was highest and lowest. I did not complete this within the hour and may work on it in the morning.

**Thoughts:** I use java daily at work, but I am very used to having the IDE to help navigate class methods and such. I am also not using commong Java methods because I am writing selenium glue and using mostly methods from that framework. So I had to look a lot of things up. While the katas were easy, since I don't do this on the daily, I had to think through things a lot. The Counting Vowels kata was real easy and I completed it in both languages real fast. The second one because of not knowing readily what I could and couldn't do in java, took longer, due to looking things up.

### Day 3: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on one 7 kata called "Resistor Color Codes" in java.

**Thoughts:** Had I started earlier in the evening this would have gone better. Unfortunately I had some running around to do, but wanted to stay on track for Day 3. I didn't realize what data structures are standard and which need to be imported, so I spent a fair amount of time getting that steup after I wrote much of the code already. I didn't complete it, but I got pretty far. Running it showed the tests failed, but the output was not very helpful as to why. I expected it to fail because I wasn't fully done, but I was returning a string similar to what they wanted.

### Day 4: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Mooooooore Katas! I completed 3x 7-kyu katas and 1x 6-kyu kata! The 6-kyu was the second one up and I got stuck on an error and couldn't figure out where it was coming from. These were all in python today. I just am not feeling the java right now.

**Thoughts:** I felt really good about myself once I finished the 6kyu one and it ranked my up to 7kyu from 8 (lowest rank). Now that python has gotten me here, I plan on doing more java and maybe some javascript soon; although, I may do that after I see some js n free code camp or explore some more tutorials off 100days hourly quota. I really want to get better with all three over time. Tribonacci sequence for the win!

**absence tomorrow unavoidable** Sadly, it is my work's holiday during my usual coding time tomorrow and I have my kids during the day. So I will more than likely have to skip tomorrow and add another day to the 100 the next day. Can't help it!

### Day 5: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Had to skip yesterday but today is day 5 now. I worked on some more katas. I was only able to complete one, sooooo tired today for some reason and most of the katas I found tonight were math based. I completed one 7kyu one.

**Thoughts:** I made it through third semester calculus in college and I am good at math normally, but tonight I was so tired the numbers were just laughing at me. So I didn't code as much as I would like to within the hour, but I at least tried. I may need to come up with a project soon so I am doing something a bit more constructive.

### Day 6: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Ran through about 4 or 5 katas tonight and this ranked my up in java! I only did java tonight. Currently 7 across the board and almost halfway to 6 overall! Moving right along!

**Thoughts:**: I had to look up a few things like MAX_VALUE because I was using a similar value in Python which is sys.maxsize. Otherwise, I had a good mix of Kyu7's and Kyu6's tonight. I skipped a few because I was wasting too much time thinking of the solution without any code written. So I figured in the interest of actually writing code, I would keep moving.

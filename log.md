### Day 0: Date

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: January 3, 2071

**Today's Progress**: Doing a review on FCC site. Starting at the beginning because I haven't looked at HTML or CSS in a long time and want to get better at front end. Remember as styles go down they override those above. inline trumps this. Id's trump classes, and `!important` trumps all. *Update*: Spent 10 extra minutes to just finish the whole HTML5 and CSS section. Onward to responsive design and bootstrap!

**Thoughts:** Its sorta like riding a bike but the CSS review is immensely helpful and how overriding works! Looking forward to using this on an actual project. I really would like to finish the certifications and do something with them! The program looks nice and I burned through a lot in an hour (per update above, this should take 5 hours)
